## What do I do? 💻

I am currently an entrepreneur, I continue to learn while venturing into ambitious and creative projects.

I have different web portals, among which, this [SeoSeu](https://seoseu.com/), my web design agency founded in mid-2020, is the one that most reflects my skills as an SEO professional. We also work in web development and design.

### My [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) for 2022-23 🗺️

This is my roadmap, in order not to get lost during the learning adventure, a map and a compass are necessary!

> I wanted to be brave and I learned to study
